        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <hr>

        <p class="lead">   When my family was providing care for our loved ones, we questioned whether to hire a stranger. We wondered if our loved ones would be safe and if the person caring for them would be knowledgeable, kind, trustworthy, and reliable?  <br>
        This is why I am committed to hiring the best. I personally interview each employee and only hire them if I feel they have these qualities. <br>
        Our team largely consists of certified nursing assistants. We have an extensive screening process, which not only includes personal interviews, but also certifications, and background checks. </p>
